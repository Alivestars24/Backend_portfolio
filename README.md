## ⚠️ Assumptions and Limitations

- **Assumptions**:
  - Users will manually input accurate stock data but can search the ticker(e.g., ticker symbols, quantities).
  - Real-time stock price data depends on third-party API availability.

- **Limitations**:
  - The UI is currently not fully responsive, and some components may not render optimally on smaller devices.
  - Free-tier APIs may have rate limits or delays in fetching stock prices.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Future Enhancements

- **Responsive Design**: Improve UI to ensure seamless usability across all devices.
- **Notifications**: Notify users about significant stock movements.
- **Offline Mode**: Allow users to view cached portfolio data when offline.
